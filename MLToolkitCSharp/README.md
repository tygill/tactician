MLToolkitCSharp
===============

A C# port of the Machine Learning toolkit for BYU's CS 478 course. It was ported primarily from the Java version, with the main change in functionality being the lack of support for quoted tokens in @attribute tags when reading ARFF files. The original C++ and Java toolkits can be found here: http://axon.cs.byu.edu/~martinez/classes/478/stuff/Toolkit.html.

Note that the included project files are for Visual Studio 2012. However, the code should work fine in other versions of Visual Studio as no fancy .NET features are used.
