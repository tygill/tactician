Machine Learning - Dominion AI

Limited to deciding what to buy at the moment (other decisions in the future)

Inputs:
    0/1  - Is card in use? (202 kingdom cards that could be in the supply though...)
    0/1  - Is Curse in use?
    0/1  - Is Platinum/Colony in use?
    0/1  - Are there +Action cards in the supply?
    0/1  - Are there +Buy cards in the supply?
    0/1  - Are there +Card cards in the supply?
    0/1  - Are there trashing cards in the supply?
    0.12 - How many Colonies are left? (Percentage?)
    0.21 - How many Provinces are left? (Percentage?)
    0.12 - How many Duchies are left? (Percentage?)
    0.12 - How many Estates are left? (Percentage?)
    0.12 - How many of each other Victory card are left?
    0.70 - How many Curses are left? (Percentage?) (Know how many there should be in a game)
    0..4 - How many piles are empty? (Percentage? - 2-4 player games end at 3 piles, 5-6 player games end at 4)
    0..L - What turn is it? (Possibly normalized logarithmically - early turns are more different than later turns. Maybe sqrt to normalize?)
    2..6 - How many players are there?
    0... - How many cards are in my deck?
    
Move Context Inputs:
    0..L - How much money do I have?
    1..L - How many buys do I have?
    
Additional Inputs:
    0/1  - Am I possessing the other player? (This actually may not matter when it comes to buying...just trashing and stuff mostly)
    0..1 - How many Ruins are left? (Percentage) (Know how many there should be in a game)
    0/1  - Is card the Bane card? (not so vital, only a limited number also)
    0... - How many of each card do I already have?
    0.10 - How many embargo tokens are there on each card?
    0... - How many Gardens do I have?
    0..1 - How many of each card is left?
    0..1 - What ratio of my deck are Actions?
    0..1 - What ratio of my deck are Victories?
    0..1 - What ratio of my deck are Treasures?
    0... - What is the average value of the Treasures in my deck? (Could be more than 5 with Philosopher's Stone, Bank, etc.)
    0... - What is the average cost of my deck? (E.g., Sum cost of deck and divide by number of cards)
    0... - How many unique cards do I have in my deck?
    ???? - Possibly other conditions for cases where there is an on-buy effect (though usually the effect isn't vitally based on current game state)
    0... - What is the total cost of the Treasures I have in play?
    0... - What is the average cost of the Treasures I have in play? (E.g., when buying Mint)
    0..L - How many Treasures do I have in play?
    ???? - Grand Market something?
    
Output:
    0..1  - How good would it be to buy each card right now? (Ideally, this would never pick a card that either isn't available or is more expensive than can be bought. It might pick cards that were available but have all been bought though, so whatever AI uses this output should do some sanity checking and just try to buy the best card possible.)
